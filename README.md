# mexico-institutions-careers

A .NET Jupyter notebook showing the process of getting all the education institutions in Mexico and their careers from an API,
organizing the data and uploading it to a SQL database using Entity Framework Core.

The whole process is explained step by step in the [notebook](/DataProcessing.ipynb).

This repository as well as the code is in English, but the data retrieved is in Spanish, so here are some translations for quick reference:
